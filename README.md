# Word-Guess-Game


Hello there!,

This is a word guessing game about the capitals of North America, the project works like a hangman game.
The computer will pick a random city and hide the letters so tou can try and guess them, if you succed you wil be rewarded with a picture of the capital city, 
a brief description of the city and learn what country it belongs to.

If you fail you will only get to see the city the computer choose and nothing else, but you can continue to play

Hope you have fun!!

P.S. hopefully in a future not to far away i will make a capital guessing game for each continent!!
